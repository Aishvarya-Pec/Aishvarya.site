## üöÄ Deployment

2. Connect your repository to Vercel.
3. Vercel will handle the deployment process.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Contact Form Email Setup

The contact form sends emails via Resend.

- Set your recipient email in `src/data/config.ts` under `config.email`.
- Create `.env.local` in the project root with your Resend API key:

  ```bash
  RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
  ```

- Restart the dev server after adding env vars.

Notes:
- Default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` which works for development. For production, set up a verified domain on Resend and use your domain email as the `from` address.
- If `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing, the API will respond with a clear error.
